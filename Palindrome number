Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome and false otherwise.
Solving this without converting it into strings. 
However, if you still wish to do this using strings, just convert the number into a string and then create a new string by reversing the original one. If both strings are equal, that is a palindrome, else, not palindrome.  

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
